"""recoveryd — the frozen Tier-1 recovery floor.

A self-contained HTTP server that survives a fully-broken Mobius
platform. It runs in its OWN container (same image, different command,
own `restart: unless-stopped`), so a platform crash-loop, OOM, or
SIGTERM cannot take it down — different cgroup, different pid1.

Design constraints (owner-signed plan _148):
  * stdlib `http.server.ThreadingHTTPServer` only — no FastAPI, no
    uvicorn, no web framework.
  * imports ZERO `app.*` and nothing from `/data/platform` (the
    agent-editable tree). The only third-party import is `bcrypt`,
    lazily inside the auth path, from root-owned site-packages.
  * its own source is baked root-owned + `chmod a-w` at
    `/app/recovery/`; a startup self-integrity check refuses to boot if
    any of its files were tampered with.
  * launched `python3 -P /app/recovery/recoveryd.py`; `-P` drops the
    script directory from sys.path[0]. The startup scrub additionally
    strips `/app`, `/data/platform*`, and cwd so `import app` can never
    resolve onto the broken platform tree.

Tier-1 floor (this MVP): deterministic, agent-free, network-free
restore. POST /recover/restore writes `/data/.recover-pending=<mode>`
(reusing the entrypoint's existing boot-time handler) then the restart
sentinel `/data/.platform-restart-requested` (acted on by the platform
container's poller -> kill pid1 -> Docker recreate -> fix loads).

Deferred (NOT in this MVP, noted for the follow-on):
  * Tier-2 SSE AI-rescue chat (lifts recover_chat_runner).
  * DB-independent `owner.json` auth (survives a wiped DB — O2). This
    floor uses the DB owner row, so it survives a broken PLATFORM but
    not a wiped DB.
