"""Isolated auth for the FROZEN recovery container (recoveryd).

Verbatim lift of `backend/app/recover_auth.py` — kept as a SEPARATE
copy inside the frozen `/app/recovery/` bundle so the recovery
container shares ZERO code with the agent-editable platform tree
(`/data/platform/app`). The platform's own `recover_auth.py` may be
broken or corrupted; this copy is baked root-owned + chmod a-w and
cannot be touched by the agent.

Imports ONLY stdlib + bcrypt (a hard backend dependency that lives in
root-owned site-packages, off the agent's write surface). It must NOT
import anything from `app.*` or `/data/platform`.

Cookie format is HMAC-SHA256-signed JSON: `<b64(payload)>.<b64(sig)>`.
Deliberately not JWT — no library, no algorithm-negotiation surface,
no library-CVE blast radius.

The recovery HMAC key is derived from `/data/.recovery-secret`, NOT
from `SECRET_KEY`. This is load-bearing: when SECRET_KEY drifts (the
documented outage mode that invalidates all JWTs) the recovery surface
is exactly when the user most needs it. Tying it to the same key means
both break together. The recovery secret is generated once
(secrets.token_hex(32)) and never rotated by anything else.
